# Rule34 API Info: Posts

Retrieving posts from the API requires adding the parameter `s=post` to the base
API URL.

```plain text
https://api.rule34.xxx/?page=dapi&q=index&s=post
```

_(including [authentication](./index.md#authentication))_

## Parameters

All of the following parameters are optional. ("Defaults to _x_" means the returned results are equivalent to specifying the parameter as _x_.)

  - **`tags`**: The query to filter posts by; works the same as searches on the
    site
    - If not specified, returns all posts applicable to other parameters
    - See: [cheatsheet](../search/.given.md)
  - **`id`**: Id of a single post to return
    - Integer
  - **`limit`**: The amount of posts returned
    - Integer
    - Hard limit of 1000 per request
    - Defaults to 100
  - **`pid`**: "Page id"; the 0-index offset of returned posts based on `limit`
    - Integer
    - Defaults to 0
  - **`json`**: Whether to return results formatted as JSON or XML
    - `1` for JSON, `0` for XML
    - Defaults to `0`
    - Resulting data differs; see [XML vs. JSON](#xml-vs-json)

> [!WARNING]
> The official Rule34 API documentation suggests you may use `cid` as a
> parameter, which represents the "change id" of a post. However, this does not
> affect the search whatsoever.

When `json` is set to `1`, an additional, optional parameter becomes available.

  - **`fields`**: Undocumented parameter; known accepted values are listed below
    - Values may be any of the following:
      - Empty string: No effect
      - **`tag_info`**: Adds an additional `tag_info` property to each post
        object
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > This parameter is entirely undocumented. The only known usability of this
    > parameter is with the value `tag_info`.

## Response Format

Data returned in the XML and JSON formats differs slightly, but in common,
simpler use cases, they remain interchangable.

### XML

XML data is returned as a root node with a list of child elements. The root
element (`posts`) has attributes specifying data about the search as a whole,
and each child element is a void `post` element with attributes regarding a
post's data.

Below is a collapsed example of XML data returned from the API.

### JSON

JSON data is returned as an array of key-value objects. Each object regards a
post's data.

If the `fields` parameter is set to `tag_info`, posts will have an additional
`tag_info` property, whose value is an array of tag objects.

Below is a collapsed example of JSON data returned from the API.

## XML vs. JSON

[XML vs. JSON]: #xml-vs-json

XML and JSON, of course, return data in different formats. However, due to
many issues, the data they return should not be considered equivalent or fully
interchangable.

### Core Differences

As XML and JSON are almost fundamentally different when it comes to storing and
serving data, there are some core differences between them that may be alike for
any API that supports both formats.

#### Values

JSON supports storing different primitive types, such as strings, numbers, and
boolean values. However, an XML element's attribute values are always strings,
so integer values are represented as numerical strings, and boolean values are
represented as `"true"` or `"false"`.

> [!NOTE]
> With that being said, from hereon, attribute values said to be _integers_ may
> be parsed as a numerical string (i.e. [the `Number` function]), and attribute
> values said to be _boolean_ may be evaluated as equal to `"true"` or not equal
> to `"false"`.

[the `Number` function]: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/Number>

### Root Node vs. Array

A difference noticable, even when 0 posts are returned, is that XML results have
a root node with useful attributes, while a JSON only returns an array, which
doesn't have any special properties.

The XML root node has two attributes:

  - **`count`**: The amount of _total_ posts that can be found from the search
    query
    - Integer
  - **`offset`**: The offset of the returned results in _posts;_ if the `limit`
    is 5 and the page is `2`, `offset` will be `"10"`
    - Integer

### Mutual Properties

The post objects of each format have mostly mutual properties.

  - **`file_url`**: The CDN URL of the main file
  - **`width`**: The width of the main file in pixels
    - Integer
  - **`height`**: The height of the main file in pixels
    - Integer
  - **`sample_url`**: The CDN URL of the downsampled image of the main file
  - **`sample_width`**: The width of the downsampled image in pixels
    - Integer
  - **`sample_height`**: The height of the downsampled image in pixels
    - Integer
  - **`preview_url`**: The CDN URL of a highly downsampled version of the main file
  - **`id`**: The unique id of the post
    - Integer
  - **`parent_id`**: The id of the post set as the parent
    - Integer, unless unset:
      - XML returns an empty string
      - JSON returns `0`
  - **`has_notes`**: Whether the image has notes associated
    - Always boolean
  - **`rating`**: The content rating of the image
    - Possible values (for _safe,_ _questionable,_ or _explicit_ respectively)
      are represented differently between formats:
      - XML returns `"s"`, `"q"`, or `"e"`
      - JSON returns `"safe"`, `"questionable"`, or `"explicit"`
  - **`tags`**: The list of tags on the post sorted alphabetically and separated
    by a space
  - **`source`**: The string set as the source of the post
    - Can be any or empty
  - **`change`**: The Unix timestamp, in seconds, of the date the post was last
    updated
    - Integer
  - **`md5`** (XML) / **`hash`** (JSON): The MD5 hash of the post
    - Always a hexadecimal string
  - **`status`**: The visibility status of the post
    - `"active"`, `"flagged"`, or `"deleted"`
  - **`score`**: The amount of upvotes given to the post
    - Integer

### Exclusive values

Regardless of the core differences between XML and JSON, there are many
server-side programmer errors that prevent full parody between usage of the two
formats. Each format has some of their own exclusive properties and info, and
some values just aren't equivalently returned.

XML posts have notable properties not found on JSON posts:

  - **`preview_width`**: The width of the preview image in pixels
    - Integer
  - **`preview_height`**: The height of the preview image in pixels
    - Integer
  - **`creator_id`**: The id of the creator of the post
    - Integer
  - **`has_children`**: Whether one or more posts have the post set as their
    parent
    - Boolean
  - **`created_at`**: The date of the post's creation
    - [`Date`]-parsable: `"Ddd Mon DD HH:MM:SS +0100 YYYY"` (`+0100` being a
      fixed timezone)
  - **`has_comments`**: Whether this post has one or more comments
    - Boolean

[`Date`]: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date>

Likewise, JSON posts have noteworthy, exclusive properties:

  - **`sample`**: Whether the main file is an image, and whether there is a
    resample for it
    - Boolean
  - **`owner`**: The username of the creator of the post
  - **`directory`**: The numerical directory of the post's files
    - Integer
  - **`image`**: The main file's filename; equivalent to `hash` plus the file
    extension
  - **`comment_count`**: The amount of comments under the post
    - Integer

When the `fields` URL parameter has `tag_info`, an additional property is
revealed.

  - **`tag_info`**: An array of the info of each tag associated with the post
    - Array of objects:
      - **`tag`**: The name value of the tag
      - **`type`**: The tag's category
        - `"copyright"`, `"character"`, `"artist"`, `"tag"`, `"metadata"`, or
          `null`
      - **`count`**: The amount of posts that use this tag
        - Integer
