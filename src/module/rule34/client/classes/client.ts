     * 
     * i have spent countless hours trying to type this correctly so that it
     * acts *equivalently* to apiUrl but that credentials aren't required in
     * params. typescript's (surely fully implemented) overloading feature makes
     * this IMPOSSIBLE by using apiUrl directly because generic types assume the
     * last-defined overload of a function, meaning usage of apiUrl as a generic
     * type parameter narrows down to a grand:
     * 
     * (s: "post", params: { ...; }, bothFormats: true) => { json; xml; }
     * 
     * this makes the only way to achieve what im looking for accessible via the
     * good ol' ctrl + (c | v). which ive been advised against using as much as
     * possible. and honestly id rather die than deal with that currently.
     * 
     * thank you microsoft for pushing an expansively typed version of a
     * (notoriously) slow enough and deeply flawed language on the programmer
     * market and making my life trying to engage in a hobby a living hell. i
     * hope each and every one of the marketers of copilot and vibe coding gets
     * analraped until their excruciated death.
     * 
     * to "vibe" "coders" who believe themselves to be legitimate programmers i
     * say this to you: go learn a hobby or get a job you can actually do
     * without the slave labour of the Ocean Boiler and Societal Development
     * Retarder 2000. you are a margin of the reason that windows 11 is
     * developed the way it is and that it has advertisements engrained into its
     * software.
     * 
     * and to the faggots that participate in the black market/cashgrab scheme
     * of vibe coding entire websites you get this from me: kill yourself.
     * preferably as long and painfully as possible, but however you do it, the
     * world needs you gone.
