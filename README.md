# booru-abuse

Booru Abuse is an NPM package to make interaction with boorus and other imageboards a breeze.

This is purely a passion project with no other motivations; I work on this for fun.

This package has yet to be fully tested, so issues are extremely helpful right now. I appreciate all the errors I can get!
